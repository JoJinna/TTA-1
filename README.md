week 3  Andres: Before the sprint 
Failed installing jarvis from sukeesh: https://github.com/sukeesh/Jarvis/tree/master
I was following the github steps to getting started with installation but I keep getting this error for step 2. I already tried their solution 1. Did any of you manage to install it?, if so can you share your steps as well as your environment variable system PATH. I'm not sure if I made a mistake installing python.
 

I tried looking into the Jarvis/Installer folder and checked unix_windows.py and helper.py. It seems there is a problem with the names of IS_WIN, log_init, and log_close. I believe from unix_windows.py it should be IS_WIN but right now it's is_windows. Also, in helper.py, I found the same issue where init_log should probably be log_init. I'm not sure if I'm the only one with this problem, as I was looking at the deployments in github and there seem to be frequent pull requests about installation. I think we can work on fixing this problem. Let me know what you think about this.

Week Three Jo : Before the sprint 
Jarvis two github link: https://github.com/projectswithdigambar/jarvis/
I  found the back up plan.  If we could not add to the bigger open source jarvis.  I found a youtuber who has his own channel with videos that help you set up your jarvis and join his open source.  The smaller the open source community of jarvis. The better the chances will be to add our translator project to his open source. I am using studio code and html to connect jarvis online. I have animated how my Jarvis will look however I have not finished putting in coding user responses. Installed github.

 week 3  sprint Objective : 2/23 -3/1
Decide to which jarvis we should use -
     Contact the backup plan open source community -
    verify that jarvis one does not have a spanish translator -
Schedule a zoom meeting
upload the google doc to github
Jo Week Goal : Set up jarvis two github open source - and finish fixing shadow  animation for  the jarvis bot and input a user input text box 
Contact jarvis two creator about any bug as well as look up a translator open source  

Andre week three Goal: Contact supkesh the Jarvis one creator to clarify the installation process and report bugs that I found. Find a translator open source 
Alya:

Week four Andres: Before Friday meeting
Follow up to our back up plan and installed jarvis from digamabar repository. Installed all the required libraries and find out he doesnt have any instructions to do this. Therefore, we can work on a read.me to make it easier to installe for other people. In addition to this, I work on a small program to test the googletranslator librarie. It was a success, so I start working on our feature. Managed to completed it but unfortunatly I cant tested it as right now theres seem to be an error on my engine folder. 

Week five Goals: Install all librarys and create are readme file with the installation instructions For Both . 
Goal  Number two - Have the jarvis running online.
Goal Number three fixing the egine code
